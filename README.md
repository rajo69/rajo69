## ⚡ What I Build With & How I Deliver Value

As an AI Engineer and Data Scientist, I focus on the complete development lifecycle of intelligent systems and the analytical process to extract valuable insights.

🔧 **AI Application & LLM Development:** I architect and build end-to-end applications powered by LLMs. My experience includes **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, fine-tuning (**LoRA, PEFT**), advanced **Prompt Engineering (CoT)**, and leveraging frameworks like **LangChain** and **FastAPI** to create robust, scalable solutions.

🧠 **Deep Learning & Machine Learning:** I construct and train sophisticated models using **PyTorch**. My project experience ranges from **Computer Vision** (CNNs, ResNet) for image captioning and classification to building predictive models (**XGBoost**) for critical business problems like customer churn.

📊 **Advanced Data Analysis & Business Intelligence:** I excel in applying **time-series forecasting**, **text analysis**, and **statistical data modelling** to identify key drivers and trends. I design and implement efficient **ETL pipelines** from various sources (SQL, Snowflake), build interactive dashboards (Tableau, Power BI), and perform comprehensive data quality checks to ensure reliable insights.

🔗 **Data & MLOps Foundation:** I design and implement the foundational data infrastructure that powers AI. This includes managing **Vector Databases (Pinecone)** for semantic search, and deploying applications on cloud platforms like **GCP** and **Azure**. I also have extensive experience in **stakeholder management**, **requirement gathering**, and working within an **Agile framework** to ensure solutions are both technically sound and strategically impactful.
