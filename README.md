# Hi, I'm Rajarshi Nandi 👋

## 🤖 Aspiring AI Engineer | Building Intelligent Systems

I build and deploy AI-driven applications, transforming complex data into intelligent, automated solutions. With a Master's in Data Science and hands-on experience with Large Language Models (LLMs), deep learning, and end-to-end MLOps pipelines, I bridge the gap between innovative AI concepts and practical business impact.

### 🚀 Key Achievements
- **🧠 Developed & Deployed AI Solutions:** Engineered `Job Lens AI`, a semantic analysis tool using LLMs (Llama 3.1) and advanced prompt engineering to deliver tangible user value.
- **🛡️ Enhanced Model Robustness:** Augmented a CNN's resilience against adversarial attacks by over **6100%** while maintaining **88%** accuracy.
- **📈 Delivered Business Impact:** Drove a **14% cost reduction** for clients and a **9% reduction in customer churn** by implementing machine learning and data-driven strategies.

## ⚡ What I Build With

As an AI Engineer, I focus on the complete development lifecycle of intelligent systems.

🔧 **AI Application & LLM Development:** I architect and build end-to-end applications powered by LLMs. My experience includes **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, fine-tuning (**LoRA, PEFT**), advanced **Prompt Engineering (CoT)**, and leveraging frameworks like **LangChain** and **FastAPI** to create robust, scalable solutions.

🧠 **Deep Learning & Machine Learning:** I construct and train sophisticated models using **PyTorch**. My project experience ranges from **Computer Vision** (CNNs, ResNet) for image captioning and classification to building predictive models (**XGBoost**) for critical business problems like customer churn.

🔗 **Data & MLOps Foundation:** I design and implement the foundational data infrastructure that powers AI. This includes building efficient **ETL pipelines**, managing **Vector Databases (Pinecone)** for semantic search, and deploying applications on cloud platforms like **GCP** and **Azure**.
